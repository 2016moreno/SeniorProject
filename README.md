<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The idea popped up when me and my friend @VoidPixel wanted to start making more recipes at home instead of going out to eat all the time. During the COVID-19 pandemic,
we realized how inactive we became and wanted to create a simple mobile application that can look up recipes at ease. Together, we made See-Food.

### Built With

* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
* [YOLO Object Detection System](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)
* [TFLite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite)
* [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/)
